# FFTDisplay (deprecated)

Please use [SignalDisplay](./signaldisplay.md) instead. If you wish to update an instrument that used the fftdisplay widget, you can simply replace fftdisplay with signaldisplay. The fftdisplay widget will remain in the code base so that older instruments which use it will continue to work.

<a name="svgfile_slider"></a>**svgfile("type", "file")** Use this identifier to pass a unique svg file to use instead of the default look and feel. "type" should be one of the following:

- "background" : sets the slider background image
- "slider" : sets the slider thumb, or in the case of a rotary slider, the inner circle. This image moves in sympathy with that the mouse as users move the slider.

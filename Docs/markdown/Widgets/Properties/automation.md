**automation(val)** Default 0. This identifier switches automation mode in Cabbage between two modes. The first, default mode, allows Cabbage to listen to automation tracks from a host DAW. Use this mode is you wish to automate parameters using automation envelopes and curves in your DAW. The second mode, 1, will allow the host to track channel updates if they happen in Csound. If you wish to send automation changes from your instrument, you will need to enable this mode.

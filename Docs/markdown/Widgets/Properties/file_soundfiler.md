**file("filename")** Sets a file for the table to display. Unlike the tableNumber() identifier, which depends on the existence of a valid function table, file() will simply display a file from disk. This can be useful if you are using one of Csound's file reading opcodes. If a full file path is not given, file() will search  in the current directory, i.e., the directory that contains the csd file that is open. It is best to keep all files in the same directory as your csd file, but if you wish to keep them in a sperate folder you can pass a full path to the file() identifier.

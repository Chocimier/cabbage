#Operators and Comments

Mathematical operators are essential to all programming languages. Csound is no different. Any a, k or i rate variable can be operated on using the standard set of mathematical operators, *, /, +, -, etc. Note that multiplying a variable by 20 does not alter the variable's value. It simply returns a new value. This new value can then be assigned for use later.

```csharp
kVal1 = 100
kVal2 = kVal1*100
```

Single line comments can be added using ; or //. Multi-line comments are be added using /* to start the comment, and **/* to end it.

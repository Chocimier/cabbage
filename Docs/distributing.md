# Distributing Cabbage instruments (Plugins/Standalone)
Cabbage users developing instruments will have Csound installed, but your target user may not. In order to avoid the need for them to pre-install Csound you can simply distribute Csound with your instruments. The best way to do this is to create an installer for your instrument that installs Csound along with all of your Cabbage files. There are several easy to use package builders for both OSX and Windows that can be used to create simple all in one installers.
